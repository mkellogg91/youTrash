-Don't know react at all, googled "React Tutorials", selected the tutorial from react's website
-created new github repo
-Error: refusing to merge unrelated histories: 
    -Googled error and pasted "git pull origin master --allow-unrelated-histories"
-Ran into issues with visual studio code asking me for git credentials anytime I tried to hit remote repo
    - googled "visual studio code keeps asking for git credentials"
    -ended up installing git credential manager for windows: https://github.com/Microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows/
-installed the react dev tools add-on for chrome, very cool!
-after spending some time going through the classic tutorial I searched for "react display data from api call" as this is my actual goal
-got a simple project up and running with some basic life-cycle hooks that allow me to start inserting logic

-a lot of really rough searching through youtube api documentation here in order to:
    -be able to access apis
    -determine which apis I need to hit to get what I want (watch history)

-After spending quite a few hours searching through google's devloper docs on youtube api's, I find out that its no longer possible to
access user's watch history information via apis here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46987690/tracking-youtube-watch-history this 
article also contains links to youtube's release notes stating that this is depracated

-I decided to audible and instead pull data from the user's liked vidoes

-spent a little time mapping results from video call into an array so I could gather the properties I wanted to display

-didn't know how to pass data from one component to another, googled and found easily on so

-created a separate component because I need to be able to dynamically create some component for each row of the table

-looked up how to dynamically create components for data in react

-got dynamic elements working

-styled everything using bootstrap, thank God for bootstrap

-fixed bugs including one "object of undefined" error on thumbnail object. this error would occur when a liked video has since been deleted and the thumbnail no longer existed
